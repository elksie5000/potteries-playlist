Master Build Summary: Potteries Music AppI. Core Layout & UI RefinementsTimeline Fix (Horizontal Venue Row): Refactor the top-right Venue tags from a wrapping grid into a single flex-row with overflow-x: auto. This protects the vertical "air" of the timeline.The "Sidecar" Window: Implement a Master-Detail pattern. Clicking a "Classics" card opens a side panel for deep-dive content (Text, Archival Images, YouTube).Note: YouTube embeds must carry a "Tangential Context" disclaimer.The A–Z Rolodex (Bands View): A vertical alphabet strip (A-Z) on the flank. Each band gets a header section with their specific gig cards stacked beneath.Filters: Alphabet letter, 5-Category Genre, and Setlist Toggle.The Venue Chapters: A vertical container for each venue.Structure: Header $\rightarrow$ Data Chart $\rightarrow$ Narrative Text Block (Stoke Live Music History).II. Tactical Build ObjectivesObjective 1: Scaffolding & AestheticBuild the basic Svelte grid for "Gig Cards."Apply the "Fanzine" look: Grayscale (100%), High-Contrast, and Xerox-style CSS filters.Load sample data for The Golden Torch, The Specials, and The Sugarmill.Objective 2: The "Object Permanence" TransitionConfigure Svelte crossfade (send/receive) and the flip directive in App.svelte.Ensure cards physically "slide" when switching between Timeline, Band Rolodex, and Venue Chapters.Objective 3: Data PlumbingPython: Build a msgspec decoder for high-speed handling of nested gig metadata.SQL: Draft DuckDB queries to group the master CSV into the "Five Eras" (Soul, 2-Tone, Rave, etc.).
