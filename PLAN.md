# Saturday Build: Phase 1 - Structural Refactoring



## Tactical Objective 1: Layout & Navigation

- [ ] **Venue Filter Fix:** Refactor top-right venue tags into a `flex-row overflow-x-auto` container to clear vertical timeline space.

- [ ] **A-Z Rolodex:** Scaffold vertical alphabet nav strip for the new Bands view.

- [ ] **Sidecar Component:** Build the detail window for "Classics" (hosting YouTube/Text/Images).



## Tactical Objective 2: View Transitions

- [ ] **Crossfade Mapping:** Assign unique IDs to gig cards for sliding between Timeline, Band Rolodex, and Venue History containers.

- [ ] **Venue History:** Build the vertical container template: [Header] > [Chart] > [Narrative Text].



## Tactical Objective 3: Data & Media

- [ ] **Category Filter:** Implement the 5-category genre logic.

- [ ] **Setlist Toggle:** Filter cards based on "Setlist Available" metadata.

- [ ] **Media Labels:** Add the "Tangential Link" disclaimer to YouTube embeds.
