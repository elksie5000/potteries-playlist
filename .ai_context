## 1. Project Vision & Aesthetic

- **Goal:** Sovereign cultural archive of Stoke-on-Trent music (70s–90s).

- **Style:** "Fanzine" / Industrial. High-contrast grayscale.

- **Interaction:** Cards must "travel" between views using Svelte `crossfade` for object permanence.



## 2. Structural Requirements (Layout Specifics)

- **Timeline View:** Primary view. Venue filters MUST be a single horizontal line (using `overflow-x-auto`) to clear vertical space for the timeline.

- **Bands View:** Vertical A–Z Rolodex navigation. Bands listed alphabetically with gig cards stacked beneath headers. 

- **Bands Filters:** Filter by Alphabet, Genre (5-category), and Setlist Toggle.

- **Venues View:** Vertical history containers. Header -> Data Chart -> Narrative text box for Stoke-on-Trent live music history.

- **Detail View:** Sidecar/window panel for "Classics" and Band details. Support for text, images, and YouTube embeds (clearly labeled as "tangential context").



## 3. Technical Stack

- **Frontend:** SvelteKit + Tailwind.

- **Animations:** Svelte `crossfade` and `flip`.

- **Backend/Data:** Python (msgspec, glom) for ETL. DuckDB for local SQL analysis.
