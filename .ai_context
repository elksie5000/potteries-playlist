#Potteries Music App: Core Context (.ai_context)
1. Project Vision
An interactive, high-performance web archive of the Stoke-on-Trent music scene (1970s–1990s). The goal is to preserve geographic and temporal history through a "Sovereign Asset."

2. Design Philosophy
• Aesthetic: "Fanzine" style. High-contrast, Grayscale, Xeroxed textures. That said, it should be modern and easy to navigate. Furthermore make it adaapt to the existing timeline dark theme which is in place. 

• Mental Model: Object Permanence. Gigs are "Physical Cards." When the view changes (e.g., Venue -> Band), the cards must "travel" to their new slots, not disappear.

3. Technical Constraints
• Framework: Svelte / SvelteKit

• Animations: Mandatory use of `crossfade` (send/receive) and `flip` for shared-element transitions.

• Data Stack: Python for ETL (msgspec, glom). DuckDB for analytical SQL on local files.
